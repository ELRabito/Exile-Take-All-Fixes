# Exile-Take-All-Fixes

What it does: This fixes a couple of issues with the take all function. For example: If you have a container with 5 different NVG's and press take all it removes one NVG of each type instead of just one.
Other small QOL changes like possibility to use take all for multiple NVG's and GPS.
